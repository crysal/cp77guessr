A geological guessing game in the world of cyberpunk 2077

Current recommendation is to play on a 1920x1080 or higher, due to wackyness with the location image.. Will try to work on it

This is a very unfinished game, but it's in working condition (somewhat)
if you have any html/css/js abilites and want to help, go ahead. it's all free and right there for the taking.
I've put comment in the index.html for what I need to get done

if you want to use the code for other games/maps, it's all free. some things just might need changing, hit me up on the twitter or something I'll help you out

Push, pull, fork or clone.
